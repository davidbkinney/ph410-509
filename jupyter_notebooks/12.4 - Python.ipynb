        "Welcome to Python week! Python is very likely the most widely-used computer programming language in the world. Certainly, it is the most widely-used programming language in the sciences. One notable exception is in psychology, where R is more common for statistical programming. However, given that Python is used in a wide variety of practical and intellectual contexts, I think it is likely the best language for philosophers to have at least some introduction to as part of a formal methods course."

        "These days, when one writes Python code, one typically uses an Interactive Development Environment (IDE). These are applications that allow one to easily write code and see the output of one's code. For getting started with Python, and for scientific uses of Python, Jupyter notebooks (i.e., .ipynb files) have emerged as the most commonly used IDE. Jupyter notebooks are great because they allow the user to write modular blocks of code that can be run one at a time and to interleave natural language text blocks between blocks of code. This makes them a very good tool for walking someone through your code. This is great when you have a result in a paper that depends on some code: you can host your Jupyter notebook somewhere like GitHub, and then point your reader to it."

The following anaology should be helpful: Google Colab is to a Jupyter notebook what Google Docs is to a Microsoft Word document. Another nice thing aabout Google Colab is that, instead of using your own laptop's computing power to run code, the default is to use free cloud-based CPUs provided by Google. Just hit the button that says 'Connect' in the top right corner of the screen, and you'll be connected to a CPU. Everything that we do in this tutorial should be easy to complete with just free-tier Colab."

Specifically, Python allows us to *loop* through a list and perform the same operation on each object in that list.

        "This unhappy state of affairs is, perhaps, unescapable if one plays the prisoner's dilemma game only once. But suppose that we could play the game with the same person 10 times, and learn the outcome after each round. Now, more strategies emerge. Let's consider three such strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Defect: No matter what your opponent does, you defect on all ten rounds.\n",
        "*   Keep Quiet: No matter what your opponent does, you keep quiet on all ten rounds.\n",
        "*   Tit-for-Tat: On the first round, you keep quiet. Then, on each subsequent round, if your opponent kept quiet in the previous round, then you keep quiet on the current round. But if your opponent defected on the prvious round, you defect on the next round.\n",
        "\n",
        "If two players playing Defect meet each other and play the game for ten rounds, then they will each incur a cost of -20, since they will both just defect each round. If two players playing Keep Quiet meet each other and play the game for ten rounds, then they will each incur a cost of -10. The same goes for two players who each play Tit-for-Tat, they will both keep quiet the whole time and end up with a cost of -10. However, things get more interesting if players playing different strategies meet:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Keep Quiet meets Defect: The player playing Keep Quiet incurs a cost of -30, and the player playing Defect incurs a cost of 0.\n",
        "*   Keep Quiet meets Tit-for-Tat: The player playing Keep Quiet incurs a cost of -10, and the player playing Tit-for-Tat incurs a cost of -10, since they both keep quiet on each round.\n",
        "*   Defect meets Tit-for-Tat: The player playing Defect incurrs a cost of -180, while the player playing Tit-for-Tat incurs a cost of -210. This is because, on the first round, the player playing Defect defects, and the player playing Tit-for-Tat keeps quiet, leading to a cost of 0 for the player playing Defect and a cost of -3 for the player playing Tit-for-Tat. But, once the player playing Tit-for-Tat learns that their co-defendant defects on each previous round, the Tit-for-Tat player also defects on the previous round, meaning both players receive -2 on the remaining 9 rounds, leading to a total of -18 for the Defect player and -21 for Tit-for-Tat player over 10 rounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, Tit-for-Tat is a kind of \"enforcement\" strategy. It rewards good behavior (keeping quiet) while punishing bad behavior (defecting). Players who keep quiet are just as well off when they meet a Tit-for-Tat players as they are when they meet another player who, like them, is purely pro-social. Players who defect are only slightly better off when they meet a Tit-for-Tat player as they are when they meet another player who, like them, pursues only their anti-social self-interest."

        "\n",
        "We will then simulate a series of \"time steps.\" At each time step, we randomly generate 50 pairs of players to play a 10-round iterated prisoner's dilemma against each other. Some players will have the misfortune of playing more than once, while some will get lucky and not have to play at all. But, in expectation, each player will play the game against another exactly once. At the end of the time step, anyone who has incurred a cost with absolute value greater than 30 will die. Then, the each players costs will be reset to 0, in preparation for the next time step.

        "As you will be able to see from the outputs, the unconditionally pro-social players who always keep quiet quickly die out. This makes sense once one realizes that any such player will die on any round where they are selected to play against a defector at least once. However, this population of \"saints\" does not plummet to zero, but instead stabalizes just above 1.6%.\n",
        "\n",
        "By contrast, the proportion of defectors and those playing Tit-for-Tat stabalizes at about 49% each. This shows that while purely self-interested startegies can be replicated via social evolution accross generations, *so too* can strategies that reward pro-social behavior with reciprocally pro-social behavior while punishing anti-social, self-interested behavior. Note that different simulations give different results, due to the inherent randomness in regarding which players play each other, and which ones reproduce, on each round. But over the course of many simulations, we get the result that defectors and tit-for-tat enforcers survive in large proportions, while unconditionally pro-social actors who always keep quiet die out. Philosophers like Brian Skyrms (b. 1938) have appealed to results like these to explain the persistance and evolution of social norms and institutions that enforce and reward pro-social behavior in human societies.\n",

For this reason, it gets very slow as we increase either the population size or the number of time steps. There are ways to make the code much more efficient, but doing so would require more Python than we have time to learn."

        "This has been a fairly surface level introduction to Python as it is typically practiced by scientists and other academics. Doing *software engineering* with Python - i.e., actually building software instead of just making notebooks to show readers the code behind your simulations or analyses - is a whole other can of worms, and one I'm not qualified to teach. However, I have now used Python in a few philosophy papers, and I think it will only be gaining popularity as a tool in the philosopher's toolkit. So, it is useful to have some exposure to it as part of a formal methods course."
